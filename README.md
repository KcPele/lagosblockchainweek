**Event:** Lagos Blockchain Week

**Role:** Speaker, Mentor, and Developer Assistant

**Proposal Title:** Empowering New Blockchain Developers with Scaffold-ETH2 at Lagos Blockchain Week

## Introduction:

I am excited to submit this grant proposal to BuidlGuidl for my participation in Lagos Blockchain Week as a speaker, mentor, and developer assistant. This event represents a significant opportunity to engage with the burgeoning blockchain community in Lagos, offering invaluable guidance and support to new developers. My focus will be on utilizing Scaffold-ETH2, a powerful toolset that can accelerate the learning curve and development process for blockchain enthusiasts and professionals alike.

## Objective:

The primary objective of my participation is to empower new developers by providing them with the knowledge, tools, and hands-on experience required to build decentralized applications (dApps) using Scaffold-ETH2. This will be achieved through a combination of speaking engagements, mentoring sessions, and practical workshops.

## Background:

Lagos Blockchain Week is a pivotal event in the African blockchain calendar, attracting developers, entrepreneurs, and investors from across the continent. The event provides a platform for knowledge sharing, networking, and collaboration, fostering the growth of the blockchain ecosystem in Africa.

Scaffold-ETH2 is an advanced toolkit designed to simplify and streamline the development of dApps on the Ethereum blockchain. Its comprehensive suite of tools and pre-configured environments make it an ideal resource for both novice and experienced developers.

## Activities and Deliverables:

1. **Speaking Engagement:**
   - **Title:** "Introduction to Scaffold-ETH2: Building the Future of Decentralized Applications"
   - **Synopsis:** This presentation will cover the fundamentals of Scaffold-ETH2, its core features, and its significance in the blockchain development landscape. I will provide a live demonstration of how to set up and deploy a simple dApp using Scaffold-ETH2.
   - **Outcome:** Attendees will gain a clear understanding of Scaffold-ETH2 and its potential to accelerate their blockchain development projects.

2. **Mentoring Sessions:**
   - **Format:** One-on-one and small group sessions
   - **Focus Areas:** 
     - Getting started with Scaffold-ETH2
     - Best practices for dApp development
     - Overcoming common development challenges
   - **Outcome:** Personalized guidance will help developers navigate their unique challenges, ensuring they can effectively utilize Scaffold-ETH2 in their projects.

3. **Practical Workshops:**
   - **Workshop Title:** "Hands-on with Scaffold-ETH2: From Zero to Deployed dApp"
   - **Content:** Participants will engage in a step-by-step process to build and deploy a fully functional dApp. Topics will include smart contract development, front-end integration, and deployment strategies.
   - **Outcome:** By the end of the workshop, participants will have built and deployed their own dApp, gaining practical experience and confidence in using Scaffold-ETH2.

## Impact:

This initiative aims to:
- Enhance the skills and capabilities of new developers in the Lagos blockchain community.
- Promote the adoption and utilization of Scaffold-ETH2, leading to more robust and innovative dApp projects.
- Foster a collaborative learning environment where developers can share knowledge and support each other's growth.
